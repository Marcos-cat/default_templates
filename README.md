# Project Templates

This is a collection of small project templates that include the required boilerplate code for each type of project included.
There are `init.sh` files that run with one argument in each directory that allow you to copy all the files into a new directory of your choosing.

    $ sh htmx/init.sh new_project_directory # Creates a directory called new_project_directory and copies boilplate files into
    ...
    Finished new_project_directory
